\chapter{Research Plan}
In this last part of the proposal, we outline the research plan for the anticipated work proposed in Chapter~\ref{ch:anticipated} and other dissertation related work as follows.

\begin{itemize}
 \item 04/2015-05/2015: Adaptive facet generation models. We will develop adaptive models to suggest and rank the right number of query facets and facet terms for queries of different ``facet-appropriateness'', under a limited display space allocation. We will investigate different classification or ranking models and design related features for deciding whether to suggest a particular generated facet and facet term.
 \item 05/2015-06/2015: Adaptive facet generation evaluations. We will extend our intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation for adaptive query facet generation. We plan to investigate a more balanced weight for wP, wR and wFP in wPRF, and incorporate the factor of facet quality into the user model to better estimate user feedback time.
 \item 07/2015-11/2015: Ph.D dissertation preparation and defense.
\end{itemize}
